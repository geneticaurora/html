    <h2> about me...</h2>
    <p class="text">
            Technology has always been a subject of passion for me, the sheer brilliance of how far we have come in a short space of time never ceases to amaze. The overpowering nature of how beautiful and destructive it can be warrants technology a mark of respect. When in the right hands magic happens; the once considered impossible becomes the possible, communication that was once lost is found again, the incurable becomes curable and that's only scraping the barrel. 
            <br><br>It truly is taken for granted and to understand its ‘soul’ better is something to behold. Being creative and a techie has been my Achilles' heel for a long time as the two rarely merge I suppose this is down to different attitudes and approaches. Creative types don't understand technology and tech bunnies don't understand creativity so you could say trying to create a synergy between the both in a career path has daunted me as coding was missing from my skill set and this is why I joined codenation to marry my passions together.

I am an out of the box kind of person and strongly believe that solutions are best found looking outside in. Be different, be creative, be a problem solver not a problem creator. I always ask myself am I part of the solution or part of the problem.
